## Hero — Spec-Driven AI Engineering

This project uses **Hero** for spec-driven engineering workflows. Hero manages specs, integrates with work trackers (Jira, GitHub, Linear), and provides structured workflows via slash commands.

### Session Title

On the **first interaction** of every session, set a concise, descriptive session title that reflects what the user is working on (e.g. "design: auth flow", "fix: cart total rounding", "deliver: export-csv"). This keeps the session list navigable.

### Natural Language Routing

When the user describes what they want in natural language, route to the appropriate Hero slash command. **Run the command — don't just suggest it.**

| User intent | Command |
|---|---|
| Bug, error, broken, fix, investigate, diagnose | `/diagnose` |
| New feature, build, design, add, plan | `/design` |
| Implement, deliver, ship, code, execute | `/deliver` |
| Review, PR, pull request, code review | `/review` |
| Break down, decompose, epic, sequence | `/compose` |
| Convention, pattern, standard, style | `/convention` |
| Decision, tradeoff, compare, choose, ADR | `/decide` |
| Explore, brainstorm, roadmap, ideate | `/discover` |
| Document, docs, explain, write docs | `/docs` |
| Release, deploy, version, ship | `/release` |
| Retro, postmortem, lessons learned | `/retro` |
| Note, capture, remember, save thought | `/note` |
| Scan, detect, onboard, stack analysis | `/scan` |
| Check, health, validate workspace | `/check` |
| Sprint, iteration, load sprint | `/sprint` |
| Import, pull issues, fetch from tracker, sync issues | `/import` |

When routing, pass the user's original context as arguments to the command. If the intent is ambiguous, present the top 2-3 options and ask.

### Key Workflow

1. **Design first**: Use `/design` to create a spec before building anything
2. **Deliver from spec**: Use `/deliver` to implement from an approved spec
3. **Debug with specs**: Use `/diagnose` to investigate bugs and produce fix specs
4. **Never work on closed items**: Commands like `/diagnose` and `/deliver` check if the tracker issue is still open before starting work

### CLI Commands

These are run in the terminal, not as slash commands:
- `hero status` — workspace state and active specs
- `hero search <query>` — find specs by keyword
- `hero import` — import issues from tracker as spec scaffolds
- `hero pull <slug>` — sync spec status from tracker
- `hero note <slug>` — quick note capture
- `hero check` — health check

### Project Structure

- `commands/` — Slash command definitions (workflows like /design, /deliver, /diagnose)
- `agents/` — Specialized agent roles (feature-delivery-lead, debug-investigator, etc.)
- `skills/` — Domain-specific knowledge and patterns
- `.hero/planning/` — Active specs being worked on
- `.hero/specs/` — Completed specs (archive)
- `.hero/knowledge/` — Project knowledge base (conventions, decisions, context)
- `hero.json` — Project configuration

### Important Rules

- **Don't assume.** Surface tradeoffs and ask questions if anything is unclear. Present multiple interpretations instead of picking one silently.
- **Simplicity first.** Write the minimum code that solves the problem. No speculative features, no unnecessary abstractions, and no error handling for impossible scenarios.
- **Surgical changes.** Touch only what is strictly required. Do not "improve" nearby code or refactor unrelated sections. Match the existing style perfectly.
- **Verify before reporting done.** Define clear success criteria for every task. Run tests or validation scripts and iterate until the criteria are met before reporting completion.
- **Local specs first.** When asked to work on bugs, features, or any tracked items, ALWAYS check what's already imported locally before querying the tracker. Use `hero search --list --type <type>` to find local specs. Only go to the tracker if the local search comes up empty. When working on multiple items (e.g. "diagnose 10 bugs"), select from locally imported specs — never bulk-query the tracker to pick work items.
- Always check spec status before doing work — don't investigate closed bugs or deliver completed specs
- When a tracker is configured, sync status with `hero pull` before starting work
- Capture novel learnings to `.hero/knowledge/` at the end of major workflows
- Specs use YAML frontmatter with fields: title, type, status, tracker_id, priority, severity
- Imported specs include tracker-prefixed fields (e.g. jira_status, jira_priority, jira_assignee) under a # Jira/GitHub/Linear comment header
